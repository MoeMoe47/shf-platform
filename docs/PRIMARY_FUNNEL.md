# SHF Primary Funnel

**Primary funnel app:** Career (`id: career`)

Rules:
- All “Start Here” links route to Career.
- If an app is marked `meta.shf.funnelPrimary: true`, it must match the primary funnel ID.
- Funding/pilot workflows should begin in Career unless explicitly overridden by Admin.

Reason:
Career is the SHF entry point for onboarding, eligibility, pathway selection, and referrals into other SHF apps.
