  "teachingTips": [
    "Model exaggerated time-first order on the board: ‘MORNING STUDY. AFTERNOON WORK.’",
    "Encourage brevity (3–5 signs per line). This prevents overloading students.",
    "Pair stronger and weaker students in partner drills to scaffold learning.",
    "Use ‘shadow signing’ — you sign silently while student voices the gloss.",
    "Celebrate every correct use of THEN and FINISH with immediate positive reinforcement."

  "sel7Encouragements": [
    "🎯 Growth Mindset: Remind students that sequencing mistakes are part of mastery.",
    "🔥 Motivation: Praise routines that are clear, even if imperfect (‘Great job putting TIME first!’).",
    "💡 Reflection: Ask students which part (time-first, THEN, FINISH) felt hardest — normalize the challenge.",
    "🌟 Dopamine Boost: Award XP or badges when students successfully use FINISH correctly in live drills."
